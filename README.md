# cuda-compress 

A CUDA version of [CvxCompress](https://github.com/ChevronETC/CvxCompress). 
I have written this code to practice my CUDA skills. The code itself is pretty much useless at the
moment and is highly under construction.

## Supported features:
* 8 x 8 x 8 Forward and inverse transform of a single block.
